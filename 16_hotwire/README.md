# The Hotwire Game

Contains code and schematics for a little project demonstrating the usage of an Arduino to
create a "Hot Wire" game. The goal of the game is to guide wand along a bend wire without touching it.

This project was used on a workshop introducing the Arduino. 

The project contains several parts with each part adding on top of the previous one until the
complete game is finished.

The hardware needed for the game can be easily created by yourself:

1. for the bend wire you can just get a piece of cable with a solid copper core (diameter ~1.5mm) and remove the insulation.
1. for holding the bend wire just take e.g. a piece of wood, drill two holes with a diameter the same as the diameter of the copper wire (e.g. 1.5mm) at both ends of the wooden piece.
Put the ends of the copper wire into these holes. Then bend the wire however you like.
1. for the wand just take a piece (e.g. 20cm) of the same copper as in step 1. Remove enough of the insulation from one end 
so you can attach e.g. some alligator clip to this end. Remove some centimeters of the insulation from the 
other end and form a small loop.
