## RFID reader with Arduino

Demonstrates the usage of the Seeed RFID reader as described here:
https://www.seeedstudio.com/125Khz-RFID-module-UART-p-171.html

Some instructions on how to use it can be found here:

Connections:

| Arduino   | RFID
------------|---------
| TX        | PIN 1
| GND       | PIN 4
| VCC (+5V) | PIN 5

Pin numbering on the RFID refers to the pin row consisting of 5 pins in total
with PIN 1 being the leftmost pin when holding the board oriented in front of you 
in a way that the 3-pin row is on top and the 5-pin row on the bottom.
The other pin row of 3 pins is not used for this project.
