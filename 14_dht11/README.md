## DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor with Arduino

Simple DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor demo
showing usage of sensor similar to the one e.g. shown here:
https://www.adafruit.com/product/386

Code is using the Adafruit DHT11 library and basically
a simplified version of the DHTTester sample code coming with this
library.

Connections:

| Arduino   | DHT11
------------|---------
| 11        | DATA
| GND       | GND
| VCC (+5V) | VCC
